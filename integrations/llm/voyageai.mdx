# Supported Models

VoyageAI offers a range of embedding models that can be used with this integration. Here's a table of the supported models:

| Model Name              | Description                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| voyage-2                | General-purpose embedding model                           |
| voyage-code-2           | Specialized embedding model for code-related tasks        |
| voyage-finance-2        | Embedding model optimized for financial applications      |
| voyage-large-2          | Large-scale general-purpose embedding model               |
| voyage-large-2-instruct | Instruction-tuned version of the large embedding model    |
| voyage-law-2            | Embedding model tailored for legal and law-related tasks  |
| voyage-multilingual-2   | Multilingual embedding model supporting various languages |

These embedding models offer various capabilities and are optimized for different domains. Choose the appropriate model based on your specific use case and requirements.
