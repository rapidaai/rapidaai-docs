    In the "Update Assistant" step:

    - You can modify the assistant's definition, including the model, instructions, and variables.
    - The current example shows using the GPT-4v model.
    - The system prompt defines the assistant's role, in this case as a minimal therapist.
    - You can add or modify arguments, such as the `user_name` variable shown.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Definition">

    In the "Change Definition" step:

    - Provide a change description that summarizes what's been updated in this version.
    - The example shows a simple description: "Change assistant version on 2023-08-22"
    - Note the warning that new versions will not be deployed automatically and manual deployment is required to update the production version.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Create">
    After reviewing your changes, click the "Create new version" button to finalize the creation of the new assistant version.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Version History">

    After creating a new version:

    - You can view the version history of your assistant.
    - The history shows different versions, including which one is currently in use.
    - Each version has a unique identifier and shows when it was last updated.

  </Step>
</Steps>

Remember that creating a new version allows you to make changes and test them before deploying to production. This helps maintain a stable production environment while allowing for continuous improvement of your assistant.
