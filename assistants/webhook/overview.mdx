## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are automated messages sent from Rapida to your specified endpoint when certain events occur during an assistant's conversation. They enable you to:

- Receive real-time updates about conversation status
- Collect conversation data for analysis or storage
- Trigger actions in external systems based on conversation events

## Key Features of Rapida Webhooks

1. **Event-based Triggers**: Webhooks can be configured to fire at specific points in a conversation:

   - Conversation start
   - Conversation end
   - Conversation failure

2. **Customizable Payload**: You can configure the data sent in each webhook, including:

   - Event information
   - Conversation data
   - Assistant details
   - Custom analysis results
   - Any arguments, metadata or options passed to the assistant

3. **Secure Communication**: Webhooks support custom headers for authentication and secure data transfer.

4. **Flexible Integration**: Webhooks can be easily integrated with your existing systems and workflows.
