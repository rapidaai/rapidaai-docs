3. **Multiple Parameter Options**:

   - Conversation Messages (default)
   - Assistant Parameters (name, prompt)
   - Custom Arguments

4. **Execution Priority**: Set the order for processing multiple analyses.

5. **Integration with Business Intelligence**: Feed data into your BI tools using assistant webhooks.

## Benefits of Analysis

## Viewing Analysis Results

Analysis results can be viewed for specific conversations:
