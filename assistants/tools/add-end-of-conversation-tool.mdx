    <Step title="Configure the Tool">
    When configuring an End of Conversation tool, you'll need to provide several key elements:

    1. **Name**: A unique identifier for your tool
       - Example: "end_conversation"
       - Use descriptive names that indicate the tool's purpose

    2. **Description**: Details on when and how to use the function
       - Example: "Ends the conversation after a task is complete or the user says goodbye."
       - This helps the model determine when to invoke the tool

    3. **Fields**: Define parameters in JSON format following the OpenAI Function Tool Call schema:

       }
       ```
