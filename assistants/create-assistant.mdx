    - **[API Request](/assistants/tools/add-api-tool)**: Make external API calls to fetch or push data in realtime
    - **[Endpoint (LLM Call)](/assistants/tools/add-endpoint-tool)**: Trigger other LLM services for your special use cases
    - **[Put On Hold](/assistants/tools/add-put-on-hold-tool)**: Pause conversation flow if you want to implement call Hold
    - **[End Of Conversation](/assistants/tools/add-end-of-conversation-tool)**: Terminate the call when conversation is over.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Finalise Name">

    - **Name**: Give your assistant a descriptive name
    - **Description**: Provide a brief explanation of the assistant's purpose

    Click "Create Assistant" when done.

    You'll see a confirmation that your assistant has been created successfully. You can now start using your new assistant or make additional configurations.
