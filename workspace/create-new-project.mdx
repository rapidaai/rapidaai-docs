To create a new project:

1. Navigate to the project listing page.
2. Click on the "Create Project" or "+" button (exact wording may vary).
3. A dialog box will appear with the following fields:

   - **Project Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name for your project.
     Example: "My Favorite Project"

   - **Project Description**: Provide a brief overview of what the project is about.
     This helps team members understand the project's purpose at a glance.

4. After filling in the required information, click the "Create Project" button.

## Best Practices for Project Creation

- Choose a clear, concise name that reflects the project's purpose.
- Write a description that gives a quick overview of the project's goals.
- Consider who will need access to the project and be prepared to add collaborators.

## Next Steps

After creating your project, you can:

- Add collaborators and set their permissions
- Create assistants specific to your project needs
- Set up knowledge bases relevant to your project
- Configure project-specific endpoints

Remember, each project in Rapida operates as its own ecosystem, allowing you to tailor resources and permissions to the specific needs of your work.
