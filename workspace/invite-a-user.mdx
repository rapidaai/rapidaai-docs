## User Roles

When inviting a new user, you can assign one of the following roles:

- **Super Admin**: Full access and control over the organization and all its projects
- **Admin**: Manage organization resources and users
- **Writer**: Can edit and contribute to assigned projects
- **Reader**: Read-only access to permitted resources

## Important Considerations

- Ensure you're assigning the appropriate role for the new user's responsibilities.
- Double-check the email address to avoid sending invitations to the wrong person.
- Be mindful of which projects you're granting access to, especially for sensitive or confidential work.

## After Sending the Invitation

- The invited user will receive an email with instructions to join the workspace.
- They will need to create an account or log in if they already have one.
- Once they accept the invitation, they'll have access based on the role and projects you've assigned.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and update user roles and project access as team responsibilities change.
- Implement a standard onboarding process for new users to familiarize them with your workspace setup and guidelines.
- Periodically audit user accounts to ensure all active users still require access.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage your team's access to your Rapida workspace, ensuring smooth collaboration and appropriate security measures.
