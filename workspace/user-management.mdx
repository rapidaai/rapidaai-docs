## Overview

In Rapida, effective user management is crucial for maintaining organization security and productivity. The platform allows you to manage users, their roles, and access levels across your organization.

![User Listing](/images/workspace/user-management.png)

The user management page displays all users within your organization. Key elements include:

- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user
- **Name**: Display name of the user
- **Email**: User's email address
- **Role**: User's role within the organization
- **Joined On**: Date the user joined the organization
- **Status**: Current status of the user account

## User Roles

Rapida uses a role-based access control system:

- **Super Admin**: Full access and control over the organization and all its projects
- **Admin**: Manage organization resources and users
- **Member**: Standard user with access to assigned projects
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to permitted resources

### Key Points:

- Roles determine the level of access and permissions a user has
- All users shown in the image have the "Super Admin" role
- Roles can be assigned at the organization or project level

## Managing Users

The user management interface allows administrators to:

1. **Add New Users**: The "Create new user" button at the top right allows adding new members
2. **View User Details**: Each user entry provides essential information at a glance
3. **Edit User Information**: The ellipsis (...) at the end of each row likely provides options to edit user details
4. **Activate/Deactivate Users**: The "Status" column shows if a user is active or not

## User Statuses

Users can have different statuses:

- **Active**: User has full access according to their role
- **Inactive**: User account is disabled (not shown in the image, but a common option)

## Best Practices

- Regularly review user roles and permissions
- Promptly update access for users who change positions or leave the organization
- Use descriptive names and professional email addresses for user accounts
- Implement a process for periodically auditing user accounts and their activities
