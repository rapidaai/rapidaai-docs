## Prerequisites

Before creating a knowledge base, ensure that you have set up an embedding model with Rapida. To set up an embedding model:

1. Navigate to the Embedding Models section in your Rapida dashboard.
2. Select the embedding model provider you want to use (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, etc).
3. Follow the provider-specific instructions to complete the setup.

For detailed instructions on setting up embedding models, refer to the provider-specific documentation in the Embedding Models section:

- [OpenAI](/integrations/openai)
- [VoyageAI](/integrations/voyageai)
- [Google AI](/integrations/google-ai)
- [Cohere](/integrations/cohere)

    After selecting the embedding model provider, you'll need to select the credentials to use:

    1. Click the "Select credential" dropdown in the Credential section
    2. Choose from existing credentials for the selected provider, or click the "+" button to add a new credential
    3. If adding a new credential, you'll need to provide:
       - A name for the credential
       - The API key or required authentication information for the selected provider

    Different providers require different credential information:
    - **OpenAI**: API key
    - **VoyageAI**: API key
    - **Google AI**: API key
    - **Cohere**: API key

    For detailed instructions on setting up credentials for each provider, refer to the respective integration documentation linked in the Prerequisites section.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Basic Information">
    Complete all required fields in the knowledge base creation form:

    1. **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your knowledge base in the text field (e.g., "Our website database").
    2. **Description**: Provide a brief explanation of the purpose of this knowledge base or what type of content it contains.
    3. **Tags**: Add relevant tags to make your knowledge base easier to find. Separate tags with commas and press Enter to confirm each tag.
    4. **Review Information**: Double-check all entered information for accuracy.
    5. **Create Knowledge Base**: Click the blue "Create knowledge" button in the bottom right corner to proceed.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Content">
    Upload the relevant content for your knowledge base:

    - Drag and drop files or click to select files from your computer
    - Supported file formats will be processed and added to your knowledge base

    ![Upload Content](/images/create_knowledge/create_knowledge_6.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Create">
    Review all the information and settings for your knowledge base.
    Click "**Upload new Document**" to finalize the creation process.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Success Confirmation">
    You'll see a confirmation that your knowledge base has been created successfully.
    The parsing and tokenization of the documents will take a while.
