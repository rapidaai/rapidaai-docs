## Understanding Document Chunks

When you upload a document to your knowledge base, the system automatically divides it into smaller segments called "chunks." This chunking process is crucial for:

- **Improved LLM Processing**: Allows large language models to process manageable portions of text.
- **Enhanced Retrieval**: Enables more precise information retrieval by pinpointing relevant sections.
- **Optimized Performance**: Reduces computational load and improves response times.

## Accessing Document Chunks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge">
    Go to the Knowledge section in the main navigation menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Knowledge Base">
    Choose the specific knowledge base containing your document.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Document">
    Click on the document you want to manage to view its chunks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Chunks">
    ![Fields for segment](/images/knowledge/chunk-list.png) You'll see a list of
    chunks derived from the original document.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enhancing Document Chunks

Improve the quality of your chunks for better matching by enriching their metadata:

<Steps>
